# Real-time-Digital-Filter-Designer
Realtime Digital Filter Design is a desktop application that allows users to design custom digital filters by placing zeros and poles on the z-plane. The application provides tools for modifying filter elements, visualizing frequency responses, applying filters to signals in real-time, and correcting phase using All-Pass filters.

## Features

### Z-Plane Plotting
- Plot the z-plane with the unit circle.
- Add, modify, and delete zeros and poles by dragging or clicking.
- Clear all zeros, clear all poles, or clear all elements.
- Option to add conjugates for complex elements.

### Frequency Response Visualization
- Display magnitude and phase response graphs corresponding to the placed elements.

### Real-time Filtering
- Apply designed filters to a lengthy signal in real-time.
- Control the filtering speed/temporal resolution via a slider.
- Input arbitrary real-time signals via mouse movement, with signal frequency determined by mouse speed.

### Phase Correction with All-Pass Filters
- Library of available All-Pass filters with visualizations of zero-pole combinations and phase responses.
- Option to add one or more All-Pass filters to the original design.
- Custom-built All-Pass filter creation by inputting arbitrary parameters.
- Enable/disable added All-Pass filters via drop-down menu or checkboxes.

## Usage

1. **Z-Plane Plotting:**
   - Add zeros and poles by clicking on the z-plane.
   - Drag elements to modify their positions.
   - Click on an element to delete it.
   - Clear elements as needed.

2. **Frequency Response Visualization:**
   - View magnitude and phase response graphs to assess filter performance.

3. **Real-time Filtering:**
   - Adjust the filtering speed/temporal resolution using the slider.
   - Input arbitrary real-time signals via mouse movement.
   - Monitor the time progress of both the original and filtered signals.

4. **Phase Correction with All-Pass Filters:**
   - Browse the library of available All-Pass filters.
   - Add selected filters to the original design.
   - Create custom All-Pass filters by specifying parameters.
   - Enable/disable added All-Pass filters as required.
